This is my very first Cpp codes here on GitHub.
So if you're new at Cpp language. This project should be your very first to make, you can add or modify the codes anytime you want.

Here's the instruction if you're new at this language:
1. Make sure have a compiler to compile your cpp files. There's many compiler you can download in websites
2. You can use any text editors. I use SublimeText and you can use any CLI such as cmd.
3. How to compile and execute the cpp file on CLI? Use this command **g++ thefilecpp.cpp** you want to compile.
4. After give a second, and you can execute the file as a executable file **a.exe**.
